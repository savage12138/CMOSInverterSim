# CMOSInverterSim
We want to design a CMOS logic circuit of 100 million inverters (i.e. 200million devices) with a circuit failure probability (pcirc) of 0.001. Further, we want to design each inverter to obtain a delay of 10ps. 

We need to compute the total energy dissipation including switching and leakage energy [neglect
short circuit energy], assuming 10% of gates are switching at a given time.
